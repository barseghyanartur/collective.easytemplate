About Template Engine
=====================

By default, Jinja 2 template engine is used. 
Please refer to `Jinja 2 documentation <http://jinja.pocoo.org/2/documentation/templates>`_
for syntax. This syntax is very easy non-XML syntax resembling Django templates.

Easy non-XML Jinja syntax means that For the basic usage, no HTML knowledge is needed.
You can use template logic in HTML and non-HTML views of Kupu. 

Template engine is switchable in the application code. Besides Jinja, 
Django and Cheetah engines are supported by collective.templateengines
template backend. However, Zope security is not supported for these template
engines and the template editor is able to escape the template sandbox and have
managerial acceess to the site.
