Introduction
============

Easy Template (collective.easytemplate) products aims to bring easy dynamic text
features for HTML and WYSIWYG editing. 

Motivation 
----------

Plone lacks out of the box support for custom, easily addable, template macros in content editors.

Use cases
---------

Possible use cases are

* Generated listings and tables

* Folder list snippets on a page

* Dynamic images

* Emailing the content text on a workflow transtion

* Emailing a person whose email is defined in the contet itself on a workflow transition

The orignal use case was help maintaining the vast number of cross-reference link lists on course modules pages.

Example
-------

You write in Kupu::

  Hello user!
  
  Please select one course from below:
  
  $list_folder("courses")
 
will result to the output:

  Hello user!
  
  Please select one course from below:
  
  * `Math <http://example.example>`_
  
  * `Marketing <http://example.example>`_
  
  * `Chemistry <http://example.example>`_

Status
------


Installation 
------------

Add to your buildout::

	eggs = 
		collective.easytemplate
		
	zcml = 
		collective.easytemplate
	
Run Add-on product installer for *Easy Template* product.

The product depends on `collective.templateengines <http://pypi.python.org/pypi?%3Aaction=pkg_edit&name=collective.templateengines>`_
and Jinja Template engine. They should be automatically be installed by setuptools.

Usage
-----

Use content type "Templated Document" whenever you want to use template tags in Kupu content.

Use content rule action "Templated email" whenever you want to use template tags in workflow transition emails.

Use portlet "Templated Portlet" whenever you want to dynamically generate portlet title or portlet content. 
Otherwise Templated Portlet behaves as the stock Static Portlet.

If you get errors in your template code, you can toggle on "Catch errors" on Template schemata
and view detailed exception tracebacks in Zope log.
