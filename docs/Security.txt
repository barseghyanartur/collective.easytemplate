Security
========

Template functions are limited to the current user priviledges - 
this means that output may vary depending on which user you have logged in.

Some tags are not secure and you need to disable them on the production site.

Security is not guaranteed for this product. For sites with high security demands,
please consult the author for the product usage.

Security unit tests are available `here <https://svn.plone.org/svn/collective/collective.easytemplate/trunk/collective/easytemplate/tests/test_jinja_zope_security.py>`_.
